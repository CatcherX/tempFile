1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,860
so I thought we should be out here in

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,810
the forest in the beautiful nature of

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,790
Sweden and record a dull b-roll sequence

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,160
using nothing but my smartphone

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,020
[Music]

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:32,230
[Music]

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,080
so most of you that are watching this

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,610
probably do have a smartphone or

9
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,730
something like the Samsung Galaxy s8 or

10
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,970
as 10 like I do this can shoot in Full

11
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,270
HD in 240 frames per second which is

12
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,460
kind of cool so it's gonna give us that

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,400
like b-roll look with kind of a steady

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,370
steady camera because you can like slow

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,230
that down and add some stabilization in

16
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,970
Final Cut Pro but I thought I'd show you

17
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,040
the whole process of shooting a be wrong

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,940
with the phone here in the forest so

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,280
usually what I do is that I try to find

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,250
some kind of details that is going to be

21
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,020
interesting for the b-roll sequence to

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,780
have as I am looking around in the

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,520
forest and when I'm looking around we

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,660
can see the stump

25
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,090
here this is kind of kind of interesting

26
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,240
it looks kind of kind of like worn out

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,810
with this part here and the moss on top

28
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,240
so this this was gonna include and if we

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,160
keep looking we can also see that

30
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,380
there's this super tiny waterfall here

31
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,100
that like super small River

32
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,479
it looks really and first thing that is

33
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,090
also something that we can include we

34
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,970
can also include some of the barks here

35
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,409
on the trees and hopefully just

36
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:56,630
hopefully the Sun is going to come

37
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,900
through the trees right here somewhere

38
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,000
and then we could get the Sun flare

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,110
coming out from that as well but those

40
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,820
are a couple of things that I think of

41
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,549
like straight up that we can include in

42
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:12,980
the b-roll sequence so let's get to

43
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,480
shooting the actual b-roll sequence

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,360
alright let's let's open up the camera

45
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,250
up here and in the camera you want to

46
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,630
make sure that you have it is set to you

47
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,150
slow motion and then basically just tap

48
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,190
where you want the focus to be and then

49
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,769
keep recording let's start with a stump

50
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:32,829
a oh my legs I feel like an old man

51
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:38,980
hmm okay I'm gonna have to rethink this

52
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,800
basically like moving back and forth a

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,780
lot of times to make sure that I get the

54
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,290
shot so just move the camera back and

55
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,190
forth and try to keep it as steady as

56
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,860
you can try to move like close to the

57
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,130
ground that actually looks really really

58
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,380
good so let's move on to the next thing

59
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,720
we're gonna try to get details shot off

60
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,680
of these channel like stumps three

61
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,630
stumps what do you call these is this

62
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,120
like three this is not branches or is

63
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,690
like cut down branches whoa what is it

64
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,330
what do you call these I don't know but

65
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,370
yeah these things we're gonna call it

66
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,380
things I'm gonna try to get shot of

67
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,970
these because this these can be

68
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,310
interesting you know to get that forest

69
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:39,160
feeling when you're hanging a cellphone

70
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,470
you don't want to do too much movements

71
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,299
in your shots because that is not gonna

72
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:44,860
look good because it's gonna look way

73
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,400
too shaky so try to hold your camera

74
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,829
like this with four fingers and then

75
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,410
basically just move and try to pan at

76
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,329
the same time as you're moving you can

77
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:57,100
also do like some tilting if you want to

78
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,840
do that because that is probably gonna

79
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,060
look good as well but I feel kind of

80
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,790
satisfied with that so let's try to get

81
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:10,510
the the smaller river here as well let's

82
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,730
see if we can't get as close to the

83
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,350
water as possible when we're getting

84
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,399
this shot yeah I'm feeling like the seal

85
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,140
on the beach I really hope that I do get

86
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,250
some good footage of this

87
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,070
[Music]

88
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,440
all right love you shot I'm down

89
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,080
I'm also gonna get a shot of the camera

90
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,639
like panning around like this because

91
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,169
that is a really cool shot especially

92
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:45,720
when it comes to like forests because it

93
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:53,130
feels immersive okay that looked great

94
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,919
so now we're gonna get a sequence of me

95
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,010
looking up towards the trees so we get

96
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,280
that like natural progression to the

97
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,729
shot that we got up towards the trees I

98
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:08,720
think that looks good

99
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:24,099
look at that that oh oh oh as the money

100
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:26,020
shot right there the absolute last shot

101
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,569
that I won't have is me walking out of

102
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:32,470
the forest to make like the whole b-roll

103
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,300
sequence feel like it's coming to an end

104
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,550
this looks really really good so I'm

105
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,349
just gonna put the camera right here and

106
00:05:38,349 --> 00:06:01,810
then I'm gonna walk towards that and

107
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,940
we're done okay let's go back to the

108
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:09,130
office and edit alright back to the

109
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:09,759
office

110
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,159
feels great there you know I know why

111
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:15,639
I'm speaking Irish I don't know let's

112
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,289
open up all the footage in Final Cut Pro

113
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:19,389
and I'll show you how I edited that

114
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:21,880
sequence together okay so the first clip

115
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,190
that we are going to use is gonna be the

116
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,680
one off the tree stump here so we're

117
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,279
gonna drag this to the timeline and

118
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,080
we're gonna like when we are starting to

119
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,840
pan we're gonna cut it so we press B for

120
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,349
the blade tool then we ain't select

121
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:41,259
backspace delete that we don't want to

122
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:43,870
have that and then we want to slow this

123
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,909
clip down because we shot everything in

124
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:48,789
120 frames per second as you remember

125
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:51,370
and then we're gonna mark this and then

126
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,750
we'll choose custom and 20 percent so

127
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,279
now that it would play it back you can

128
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,440
see that looks really good it looks kind

129
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,750
of steady as well so I don't know if we

130
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,360
gonna add some stabilization to this but

131
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,550
the clip doesn't have to be longer than

132
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,800
maybe like 2 or 3 seconds so we gonna

133
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,400
cut the clip at 3 seconds to begin with

134
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,560
I think so when it's the beef or the

135
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,090
blade tool and then we're gonna cut it

136
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,430
you're gonna mark the rest of the clip

137
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,979
and hit backspace the second clip that

138
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:23,139
we're going to use is gonna be where I

139
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:24,390
look around

140
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,760
the forest basically and you had the Sun

141
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,830
coming in the back and looks really

142
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,110
really good so you know drag this to the

143
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,600
timeline like that and the phone didn't

144
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,250
really rotate so we're gonna have to do

145
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,370
that by ourselves and we're gonna mark

146
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,580
the clip we're gonna go up here to the

147
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,960
transform and then we're gonna choose

148
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,770
the rotation and his minus 90 and then

149
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,920
we're gonna make the clip bigger so

150
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,660
we're gonna drag it up on the scale to

151
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,730
180 and then we want to slow the clip

152
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,180
down so we're gonna slow choose custom

153
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,130
and 20% this is not gonna be longer than

154
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,830
like two or three seconds so we're gonna

155
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,010
cut it as six seconds like that maybe we

156
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,650
can take the next clip is gonna be when

157
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,800
like we pen on the trees I think that is

158
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,410
gonna fit good into here so I'm gonna

159
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,510
choose that one the same thing here we

160
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,960
want to slow this down mark this which

161
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,440
you want to choose custom again 20

162
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,270
percent I think you know by now so I

163
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,159
don't have saved and then we can add a

164
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,669
speed ramp here so shift be at the

165
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,940
playhead and then go forward some rock

166
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,390
here shift B and we're gonna choose fast

167
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:51,060
times 8 so perfect perfect and now I

168
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,060
wanna have a clip of the water so we're

169
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,210
gonna choose this that is a good

170
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,040
sequence so we're gonna choose this one

171
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,640
and we're gonna drag it to the timeline

172
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,200
slowing this down so we're gonna go back

173
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,550
to the beginning and then we're going to

174
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,000
include the clip off the tree bar to

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,010
that I shot as well I'm going to drag

176
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,350
this just after the first clip that we

177
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,140
got and slow this down as well okay

178
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,900
let's do a speed ramp here shift B and

179
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,170
then move forward to some run here just

180
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,589
so that we can see the Sun

181
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,519
we have my face looks good as the forest

182
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,019
up spinning around the water and then we

183
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:35,529
can finish this sequence off by me

184
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:39,769
walking away into the forest right and

185
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:41,809
since all the clips have some kind of

186
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:43,790
motion in them the last cut feels a

187
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,920
little bit out of place but we're gonna

188
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,259
add some fake motion to it so that it

189
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,209
feels more dynamic so what you want to

190
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,639
do is go up to the transform tab and

191
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,189
then you want to go in just a little bit

192
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:58,730
till I say a hundred and twenty and then

193
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,509
we're gonna drag the position X to the

194
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:07,550
right to minus 185 then we want to set a

195
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:13,249
keyframe so that when we move forward to

196
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:16,639
some around here you want to set this to

197
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,850
zero and we can play that back to see

198
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,120
how it looks nice dynamic motion going

199
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,689
on here

200
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,180
in the last clip - and of course we're

201
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,180
gonna add the anamorphic bars so let's

202
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,819
do that by choosing the generators and

203
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:34,250
then choose custom we're gonna drag this

204
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,040
to the timeline and it's extended all

205
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,220
the way that our clip is playing and

206
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,779
then we're gonna choose crop top crop

207
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:48,620
top 960 and then we're gonna hold alt

208
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,370
drag this out and then we're gonna reset

209
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,769
the top one like that and then go to the

210
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:01,339
bottom one and type 960 there as well

211
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:04,839
and now we got ourselves a really cool

212
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,600
b-roll sequence that is shot entirely on

213
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,910
a smartphone that looks like this

214
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,840
[Music]

215
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:31,789
[Music]

216
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,730
every note that you enjoyed this video

217
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,740
because this video is something that I

218
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,080
planned on shooting a long time but I

219
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,330
actually thought it was gonna be way

220
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,270
harder than it was because shooting that

221
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,130
b-roll was really really simple actually

222
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,010
and you know I really hope that you feel

223
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,200
more confident in taking your cell phone

224
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,330
go out shoot some great content create

225
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,550
some dope be roles with that because I

226
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,890

241
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,839
as boss I wonder if I can do a couple of

242
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,630
American excellency the only accent that

243
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:41,520
I really know in the USA is busily this

244
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,160
one and I don't know what if this is an

245
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,360
accent I don't know

246
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,700
but and you know this was always Presley

247
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,029
accent and I guess y'all can speak and I

248
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:58,800
guess your own can speak and take some

249
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,980
right is that an accent I think that is

250
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,779
an action of the United States of

251
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:09,050
America I don't know is it
